Why should you care. VIM is crossplatform and is instealled on almost all webservers.
Good for your health. Reduces wrist pains. (I've been in physical therapy twice in my career and keeping finders on the keyboards helps

Modes

Insert 
Normal
Command - like drasitcally changing the document

Commands:
:e or :edit then target a file to open
:tabnew
:tabe
:set used to setup things that you normally do with a .vimrc
:3 = jump to line 3 || 3G will also do the same.

To Transfer from insert mode to command mode
Esc or Ctrl+[

Command mode movements:
(recommended to not rely on arrow keys by beginners... not always an easy path.

        k
        ^
    h<      >l
        v
        j

Always try to avoid using the mouse since it will ultimately confuse you. 

You can also jump quick the folling ways:
10j - execute j command 10 times
100l - execute l 100 times.
:30 - moves cursor to line 30 from any where in the file in command mode.

These moveement already will make you a more productive than another editor. Also the wrist cramps do away.

wWbBe

w - will jump you between words
W - will jump you between words by white space
b - do the same as w but backards
B - will do the opposite of W

Jumping characters
0 - take you to the first character of the line
$ - take you to the last character of the line
^ - first non-blank character of the line

cw - changeword
TEST,HERE CAN YOU SEE M!

A word in vim will move you bewteen word that

Start of more advanced stuff here: fFtT

f - Forward until 
F - Backward until
t - Forward until ~ this will not include the cursor aka exclusive
T - Back until ~ this will not include the cursor aka exclusive

Copy Paste
-----------------------

Load external files into your rc file like bash to keep this in a psuedo module like format.

Example:
source ~/.vim/startup/commands.vim <- notice these need a .vim extension
y  -  yank
yy - yank line Example 2yy will copy 2 lines down this will account the first line as 1 unlike all command in vim that act like array.
p - paste after cursor
P - paste before cursor

example: yw - yankword

THis is a test
THis is a = y3w

These are super powerful and once understood will become ROCKSTAR

Motions
-----------

gg - top of file
G - bottom of file
ggY - will select the entire file


SEARCHING COmmands
Suuports full regular expressions
/ - Forward Search
? - Backward Search
* - word under the cursor THIS IS RANK THE NUMBER COMMAND IN VIM
g* - word under the cursor (unbounded)
# - same as * but backward
g# - unbounded
n - NExt result forward
N - Next result Backward:
\c - case insensetive for current search

Unboudned means that you can search for fragments of words while bound needs to match exactly
There is also a setting where you can ingorecase 
Example:
:set ignorecase - this will allow you toggle between cases



But it is how you enter insert mode that offers some advantage:

i	insert before character under cursor
I   insert at first character on line
s   delete character and instert in character space.
S   delete line and insert at the begging of the line

a	insert after cursor
I	insert at beginning of current line
a   instert mode after character
A	insert at end of the line
o	starts insert mode in a new line below current one
O	insert in a new line above current one

Insert keys:
iIsSaAoOC

daw - delete word under cursor
daW - delete WORD under cursor

You can also enter insert mode by replacing existing text at the same time:

ciw	("change inner word") change word under cursor
ci"	change double-quoted string (but keep the quotes)
ci(	change text between matching parentheses, also works with brackets
cc	change whole line::
------------
Command mode
-------------
gg  top of file
G   Bottom of file
u - Undo
U - Undo all since last write
Cntrl+r - Redo
:set spell - turn on and off spell check
Visual Mode

Spelling:
Turn spelling on = :set spell
]s - next spelling error
[s - prev spelling error
z= - spelling suggestions

MACRO
|________________________________________________
How to create macros
You hit q to record and then q again to stop in normal mode
To run the macro you hit @ and then the key mapped to the macro
See you macros by typing :reg or :register
You can modify the register by using a :let command.

When recording you should bind to a key:
1q then q to end
10@1 to run the macro 10 times.

Writing a macro to reg like this
:let @a=whateveryouwantthemacrotobe

hit q to go into macro mode.

Example: qa <- this sets the registry to a.
Do something.
Then hit q again to end the recording. This will work in any mode with anything. insert visual command tab etc... its sick kid!

TO execute the macro you hit the @ key.
Example @a = @theRegister you saved the macro in.

To execture the macro more than once you can type 4@a to run the macro 4 times.

When making macros you should visualize how the macro will. you need to be procsise with how the 

You can also open registers and modify them.

To edit your macro you type :reg

Also you can copy one macro to another register. something like this: :let @a = @c

vundle
pathogen

The above are more or less manditory to install if you want to install other plugins
So you drop git repos into your bundle and then thats it.

The proper method with git is to use the submodule instead of clone. This way you only pull the latest from the head of the git head.
Example: cd ~/.vim/plugins && git submodule gitXYZ

OTHER GREAT PLUGINS
NERDTree <- this allows you to have a project/home directory and also allows you to copy and modify files in an easier method. SUDO IDE
<leader .N might be a good method to open NERDTree but there might be another method.

EasyMotion
Will mask your search with the letters that will take you where you want to go.

Powerline
Pimps out the bottom line of your VIM. There are settings for this that i think go into the rc file

Fugitive
Actived by the :G then you will see the list of the commands.
