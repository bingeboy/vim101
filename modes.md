#Vim Modes

Vim has many different modes. Typically you will use the following:

```
Normal 
Insert
Visual
Visual Block - Cntrl+v
```

These three will be your primary modes you move in and out of.
While going using the modes you may breifly go in aound out of other modes but I think any furthur information will make VIM more confusing,
for a fully list of mode you can view here: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#vim-modes-intro/
