#Basic Commands
###normal mode movements
(recommended to not rely on arrow keys by beginners... not always an easy path.

        k
        ^
    h<      >l
        v
        j

Always try to avoid using the mouse since it will ultimately confuse you. 

You can also jump quick the folling ways:
10j - execute j command 10 times
100l - execute l 100 times.
:30 - moves cursor to line 30 from any where in the file in command mode.

These moveement already will make you a more productive than another editor.
