###History Lesson

The original code for VI(which later spun off into Vim), was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex.
Bill Joy later became a Co Founder of Sun, in 1982.

Prior to VI most developers used a editor called ED which was wasn't even design to be used with computers.

The name vi is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the command visual in ex; the command in question switches the line editor ex to visual mode

The Vim started as "Vi IMitation" on the Amiga in 1988, but was later relabeled "Vi IMproved" and released to other systems.

Vim is written in C and Vimscript.

Vim comes pre installed in almost every version of Linux, and is also one of the default editors on OSX, yes there is a version of windows, the Amiga, on and on.
Elvis is a clone of Vim for Unix. So dude its there.
